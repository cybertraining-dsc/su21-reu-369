## Abstract

Cervical Cancer is an increasing matter that is affecting various women across the nation, in this project we will be analyzing risk factors that are producing higher chances of this cancer. In order to analyize these risk factors a machine learning technique is implemented to help us understand the leading factors of cervical cancer.

## 1. Introduction

Cervical cancer is a disease that is increasing in various women nationwide. It occurs within the cells of the cervix (can be seen in stage 1 of the image below). This cancer is the fourth leading cancer, where there are about 52,800 cases found each year, predominantly being in lower developed countries. Cervical cancer occurs most commonly in women who are within their 50's and who has symptoms such as watery and bloody discharge, bleeding, and painful intercourse. Two other common causes can be an early start on sexual activity and multiple partners. The most common way to determine if one may be affected by this disease is through a pap smear. When witnessed early it, can allow a better chance of results and treatment. 

Cervical cancer is so important for the future of reproduction, being the cause of a successful or unsuccessful birth with completions like premature a child. The 
cervix help keeps the fetus stable within the uterus during this cycle, towards the end of development, it softens and dilates for the birth of a child. If
diagnosed with this cancer, a  miracle would be needed to conceive a child after having treatment. Most treatments begin with a biopsy removing affected areas of
cervical tissue. As it continues, to spread radiotherapy might be recommended to treat the cancer where may affect the womb. lastly, one may need to have a
hysterectomy which is the removal of the womb.
 
In this paper, we will study the exact cause and risk factors that may place someone in this position. If spotted early it wouldn’t affect someone’s dream chance of conceiving or affect their reproductive parts. Using various data sets we will study the way everything may alignes in causes and machine leaning would be the primary technique to used interpretate the relation between variables and risk factor on cervical cancer.

- Find literature on Cervical Cancer and images of Cervics 
- Analyzing reading and explain the importance of cancer in the cervix and along with how it affects the future of 
the cervixs

## 2. DataSets

- The age of a person 
- Medical status 
- Tabacoo intake 
- resources: <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8691126>
 
## 3. Other People Works

research of work others have done with the data set and what is  learned from others work.
put a refrence in section #9 for each work i have found

## 5 Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

With the help of Gregor, Yohn and carlos this project was acheieved witj the best with the best results possible.

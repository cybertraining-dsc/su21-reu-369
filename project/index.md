**Keywords:** tensorflow, example. 

## 1. Introduction





## 2. Report Format

The report is written in (hugo) markdown and not commonmark. As such some features are not visible in GitHub. You can 
set up hugo on your local computer if you want to see how it renders or commit and wait 10 minutes once your report is 
bound into cybertraining.

To set up the report, you must first `replace` the word `hid-example in this example report with your hid. the hid will 
look something like `sp21-599-111`

It is to be noted that markdown works best if you include an empty line before and after each context change. 
Thus the following is wrong:

```
# This is My Headline
This author does ignore proper markdown while not using empty lines between context changes
1. This is because this author ignors all best practices
```

Instead, this should be 

```
# This is My Headline

We do not ignore proper markdown while using empty lines between context changes

1. This is because we encourage best practices to cause issues.
```

## 2. DataSets

Description about my data sets
 
## 3. Other People Works

research of work others have done with the data set and what I have learned from that work.
put a refrence in section #9 for each work i have found 

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.

## Abstract

Cervical Cancer is an increasing matter that is affecting various women across the nation, in this project we will be analyzing risk factors that are producing higher chances of this cancer. In order to analyize these risk factors a machine learning technique is implemented to help us understand the leading factors of cervical cancer.

## 1. Introduction
Cervical cancer is a nationwide issue that is increasing in a number of women, occuring within the cells of the cervix. This cancer is the fourth leadiing cancer, where there  are about 52,800 cases foundt  are found each year, predminatly being in low developed countries. This occurs most commnly in women who are withing their 50's and who have sympotoms such as watery and bloody discharge, bleeding, and painful intercourse; two other common cuase can be an early srat on sexual activity and multiple parnters. The most common way to determine if one maybe affected by this is through 
- Find literature on Cervical Cancer, Images of Cervics 
- Analyzing reading and explain the importance of cancer in the cervix and along with how it affects the future of 
the cervixs

## 2. DataSets

- The age of a person 
- Medical status 
- Tabacoo intake 
- resources: <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8691126>
 
## 3. Other People Works

research of work others have done with the data set and what is  learned from others work.
put a refrence in section #9 for each work i have found 

## 4. Images

## 5 Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 8. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.

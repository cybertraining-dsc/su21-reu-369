## Abstract

Cervical Cancer is an increasing matter that is affecting various women across the nation, in this project we will be analyzing risk factors that are producing higher chances of this cancer. In order to analyize these risk factors a machine learning technique is implemented to help us understand the leading factors of cervical cancer.

## 1. Introduction
Cervical cancer is a issue that is increasing in various women nationwide, it occurs within the cells of the cervix (can be seen in stage 1 of the image below).
This cancer is the fourth leading cancer, where there are about 52,800 cases found each year, predominantly being in lower developed countries. This occurs most
commonly in women who are within their 50's and who have symptoms such as watery and bloody discharge, bleeding, and painful intercourse; two other common causes
can be an early start on sexual activity and multiple partners. The most common way to determine if one may be affected by this is through a pap smear, when
witnessed early it can allow a better chance of results and treatment. Below you can see the stage at which this cancer occurs, giving a visualization of how it
affects the cervix. 

Cervical cancer is so important for the future of reproduction being the cause of a successful or unsuccessful birth with completions like premature a child. The 
cervix help keeps the fetus stable within the uterus during this cycle, towards the end of development, it softens and dilates for the birth of a child. If
diagnosed with this cancer a  miracle would be needed to conceive a child after having treatment. Most treatments begin with a biopsy removing affected areas of
cervical tissue. As it continues to spread radiotherapy might be recommended to treat the cancer where may affect the womb. lastly one may need to have a
hysterectomy which is the removal of the womb. 
 
In this paper, we will study the exact cause and risk factors that may place someone in this position. If spotted early it wouldn’t affect someone’s dream chance of conceiving or affect their reproductive parts. 

- Find literature on Cervical Cancer and images of Cervics 
- Analyzing reading and explain the importance of cancer in the cervix and along with how it affects the future of 
the cervixs

## 2. DataSets

- The age of a person 
- Medical status 
- Tabacoo intake 
- resources: <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8691126>
 
## 3. Other People Works

research of work others have done with the data set and what is  learned from others work.
put a refrence in section #9 for each work i have found

## 5 Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 8. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
